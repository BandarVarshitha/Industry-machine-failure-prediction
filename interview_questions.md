## General Questions
1. **What is the primary objective of this project?**  
   The project aims to predict machine failures using sensor data and machine learning, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

2. **Can you explain the architecture of the system and how the components interact?**  
   The system consists of a Flask backend for API endpoints, a frontend for user interaction, a database for storing machine and sensor data, and a machine learning model for failure predictions. 

3. **What technologies and frameworks are used in this project?**  
   Flask (backend), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend), MySQL (database), XGBoost (machine learning), and Plotly (visualizations).

## Backend (Flask)
4. **How does the `/predict` endpoint work, and what data does it expect?**  
   The `/predict` endpoint accepts JSON data with machine and sensor features, validates the input, and uses a trained XGBoost model to predict failure probability and reasons.

5. **How do you handle database connections in `app2.py`? What happens if the connection fails?**  
   The `create_db_connection` function establishes a MySQL connection. If the connection fails, an error is logged, and the function returns `None`.

6. **What is the purpose of the `create_db_connection` function, and how is it used across the project?**  
   It centralizes database connection logic, ensuring consistent error handling and reuse across API endpoints.

7. **How are reasons for failure determined in the prediction logic?**  
   Reasons are derived from input features exceeding predefined thresholds (e.g., high temperature, excessive vibration).

8. **How do you ensure the `/predict` endpoint validates input data?**  
   The endpoint checks for missing or invalid fields, replaces `None` values with defaults, and ensures non-negative numerical inputs.

## Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
9. **How is the prediction result displayed dynamically on the `Prediction.html` page?**  
   The result is displayed in a styled container below the form using JavaScript to update the DOM with the prediction response.

10. **How does the multi-step form navigation work in the prediction form?**  
    JavaScript tracks the current step and toggles visibility of form sections using `classList.toggle`.

11. **What styling techniques are used to align the prediction result with the form?**  
    Flexbox is used to align the form and result side-by-side, with responsive adjustments for smaller screens.

12. **How do you handle responsive design for the prediction form and result?**  
    Media queries adjust the layout to stack the form and result vertically on smaller screens.

## Machine Learning
13. **What machine learning model is used in this project, and why was it chosen?**  
    XGBoost is used for its high performance with tabular data and ability to handle missing values.

14. **How is the model trained, and what metrics are used to evaluate its performance?**  
    The model is trained on historical machine data using features like temperature and vibration. Metrics include accuracy and classification reports.

15. **What features are used for training the model, and how are they preprocessed?**  
    Features include sensor readings (e.g., temperature, vibration) and machine attributes (e.g., age, workload). Missing values are filled, and categorical variables are one-hot encoded.

16. **How do you handle missing or invalid data during training and prediction?**  
    Missing values are replaced with defaults (e.g., `0`), and invalid values (e.g., negatives) are clipped to valid ranges.

## Database
17. **What tables are used in the database, and what kind of data do they store?**  
    Tables include `Machines` (machine details), `SensorData` (sensor readings), `FailureRecords` (failure history), and `MaintenanceSchedule` (maintenance plans).

18. **How is maintenance scheduling data managed in the database?**  
    Maintenance schedules are stored in the `MaintenanceSchedule` table with fields like `Scheduled_Date`, `Maintenance_Type`, and `Estimated_Cost`.

19. **How do you ensure data consistency when inserting records into multiple tables?**  
    Transactions are used to ensure atomicity, and `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` handles updates for existing records.

## Error Handling and Logging
20. **How are errors handled in the Flask application?**  
    Errors are logged using Python's `logging` module, and appropriate HTTP error responses are returned to the client.

21. **What logging mechanisms are in place to debug issues in the backend?**  
    The `logging` module logs errors, warnings, and info messages to the console, including database and prediction errors.

22. **How do you handle API errors in the frontend?**  
    JavaScript displays error messages in the UI when API calls fail, using fallback content like "Failed to fetch data."

## Performance and Optimization
23. **How do you optimize the performance of the machine learning model?**  
    Feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and efficient preprocessing are used to optimize the model.

24. **What steps are taken to ensure the Flask application can handle multiple requests efficiently?**  
    The application uses a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn and connection pooling for the database.

25. **How do you manage large datasets in the database and during model training?**  
    Indexing is used for faster queries, and data is sampled or batched during training to fit in memory.

## Advanced Topics
26. **How would you scale this application for a larger number of machines?**  
    Use distributed databases, deploy the Flask app on a cloud platform, and implement load balancing.

27. **How would you implement real-time monitoring for machine health?**  
    Integrate IoT devices to stream sensor data to the backend using WebSockets or MQTT.

28. **What additional features could be added to improve the prediction accuracy?**  
    Include more features like environmental conditions, use ensemble models, and retrain the model periodically.

29. **How would you integrate this system with IoT devices for real-time data collection?**  
    Use protocols like MQTT or HTTP to send sensor data to the backend, and process it in real-time using a message queue.

30. **How do you ensure the security of sensitive data in this project?**  
    Use HTTPS for secure communication, encrypt sensitive data in the database, and implement authentication for API access.
